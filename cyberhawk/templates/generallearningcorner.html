<h3>WHAT IS CYBER CRIME ?</h3>
<br>
Cyber crime can be defined as a crime or an unlawful act where the computer is used either as a tool, a target or both. In other terms, cyber crimes in India can be defined as an unauthorized access to some computer system without the permission of rightful owner or place of criminal activity and include everything from online cracking to denial of service attacks. 
Some examples of cyber crime include phishing, spoofing, DoS (Denial of Service) attack, credit card fraud, online transaction fraud, cyber defamation, child pornography, etc.
Cyber criminals always choose an easy way to make big money. They target rich people or rich organizations like banks, casinos and financial firms where the transaction of a huge amount of money is made on an everyday basis and hack sensitive information. 
Catching such criminals is difficult. Hence, that increases the number of cyber-crimes. Computers are vulnerable, so laws are required to protect and safeguard them against cyber criminals.<br>

            Phishing is the act of sending an e-mail to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft. The e-mail directs the user to visit a web site where they are asked to update personal information, such as passwords and credit card, social security, and bank account numbers that the legitimate organization already has. The Web site, however, is bogus and set up only to steal the user’s information. By spamming large groups of people, the phisher counted on the e-mail being read by a percentage of people who actually had listed credit card numbers with legitimately.
